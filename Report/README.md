# MakeNestingPlan

Tool for nesting report generation in Intergraph SmartProduction 2018 (Nestix Cutting). Reads nxl files and outputs pdf.

## TODO

- Do something with font embedding to reduce resulting pdf size
- Move db-releted code to separate project using entity framework
- Use xpath instead XDocument
- Introduce report designer tool
- Parse more info from nxl (such as annotations)
- Rewrite this to golang service
